Sure, I'll provide the setup steps for Babel and Webpack in a format that should be easily copyable into WordPress. You can follow these steps:

1. **Initialize Your Project:**

   ```
   mkdir my_project
   cd my_project
   npm init -y
   ```

2. **Install Webpack and Webpack CLI:**

   ```
   npm install --save-dev webpack webpack-cli
   ```

3. **Install Babel:**

   ```
   npm install --save-dev @babel/core babel-loader @babel/preset-env
   ```

4. **Create Babel Configuration:**

   - Create a `.babelrc` file in your project root and add:
     ```
     {
       "presets": ["@babel/preset-env"]
     }
     ```

5. **Configure Webpack:**

   - Create a `webpack.config.js` file in your project root and add:

     ```javascript
     const path = require("path");

     module.exports = {
       entry: "./src/index.js",
       output: {
         path: path.resolve(__dirname, "dist"),
         filename: "bundle.js",
       },
       module: {
         rules: [
           {
             test: /\.m?js$/,
             exclude: /(node_modules|bower_components)/,
             use: {
               loader: "babel-loader",
               options: {
                 presets: ["@babel/preset-env"],
               },
             },
           },
         ],
       },
     };
     ```

6. **Create Your JavaScript File:**

   - Inside the `src` directory (create it if it doesn't exist), create an `index.js` file.

7. **Add Build Scripts to `package.json`:**

   - Modify your `package.json` to include:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "build": "webpack --mode production"
     }
     ```

8. **Build Your Project:**

   ```
   npm run build
   ```

9. **Optional: Install and Configure Development Server:**
   ```
   npm install --save-dev webpack-dev-server
   ```
   - Add to `package.json`:
     ```json
     "scripts": {
       "start": "webpack serve --open --mode development"
     }
     ```

### Copying to WordPress:

- Copy each code block and paste it into a "Code" block in the WordPress Gutenberg editor.
- Ensure that the formatting remains consistent after pasting.
- You might need to adjust the indentation or line breaks manually if they don't appear correctly in WordPress.

This should help you incorporate these instructions into your WordPress post or page effectively.
